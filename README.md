# Zika-Project
Team Project for Sesync course

Our project that we would like to bring to the class is focused on developing informative and interactive visualizations of the current (and potentially projected, pending the outcome of an independent project) Zika case counts both in and outside the continental US. The goal is to implement an easily updateable (as new case counts are received) script that allows us to produce interactive visualizations of the spatio-temporal disease burden
